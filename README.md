## Groups

### Components
specificity: 0010

### Parts
specificity: 0010

### Options
specificity: 0020
Options used in combination with parts get a specificity of 00x0 depending on the amount of nesting. Nest to your heart's content.

### Tweaks
specificity: 0110

### Locations
specificity: 0111 to 0120

## benefits

- can easily add/remove the options since they're just classes.
- don't have to retype the component name multiple times in the markup
- can apply multiple options to a part
- don't have to use @extend so less bloat in generated CSS
- order of classes doesn't matter
- the loading order of stylesheets no longer matters, so you can [glob load](https://github.com/chriseppstein/sass-globbing) your stylesheets if you want, or load them on demand w javascript.

## drawbacks

- if you have two components with the same options and you're using both those components on a single partent it won't know which modifier to use. If only CSS had full on regexp selectors. Better not to use more than one component per element anyway.

## Getting Started

## TODO
- make pretty demo and host on gh-pages
- think of cool name
- simple unit test for specificity
- ship mixins as gem
- update docs
- write about creating options/mods that call 
- mixins for greater flexibility
